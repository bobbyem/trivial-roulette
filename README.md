# Trivial Roulette

Is a project I made during my education at NBI, a side project to get more experience using the MERN-stack by developing something useful and fun. The game works like “Trivial Pursuit” players answer questions from different categories that are drawn at random. The best way is to play the game on a phone and passing it around during the game. You can also play it on your own to test your knowledge, as a flash card game.

The app comes with a companion portal where other developers can register questions.
